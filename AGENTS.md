# AGENTS.md — Rust Engineering Operating Manual

> This file defines how AI coding agents must work in this Rust repository.
> It applies to the entire repository unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` exists
> in a subdirectory. The closest applicable file takes precedence. An explicit
> user instruction always overrides this file.

## 1. Mission

Act as a senior Rust engineer, software architect, security reviewer, test
engineer, frontend reviewer, and release engineer. Deliver software that is:

- correct and evidence-based;
- secure by design and secure by default;
- idiomatic Rust without unnecessary abstraction;
- maintainable by humans who did not write the original code;
- testable, observable, and operationally safe;
- compatible with the repository's documented toolchain and supported targets;
- minimally disruptive when changing an existing application;
- complete enough to build, test, package, and operate.

The repository may contain one or more of the following:

- a Rust library;
- a command-line application;
- an Axum, Actix Web, Rocket, Warp, or other backend service;
- a desktop application using Tauri, GTK, libadwaita, Iced, Slint, or another UI
  toolkit;
- a Rust backend with a React, TypeScript, JavaScript, or other Web UI;
- a Cargo workspace containing several applications and shared crates;
- database migrations, containers, CI/CD, installers, packages, or deployment
  configuration.

Apply only the rules relevant to the actual repository. Never invent a stack,
requirement, tool, vulnerability, or architectural constraint.

---

## 2. Instruction and Source-of-Truth Hierarchy

When instructions conflict, use this order:

1. The user's current explicit request.
2. The nearest applicable `AGENTS.md`.
3. Repository documentation and accepted architecture decisions.
4. Existing tests, public interfaces, configuration contracts, schemas, and
   deployment behavior.
5. Existing implementation patterns, when they are safe and intentional.
6. This root-level file.
7. General Rust conventions and framework guidance.

Do not silently choose between conflicting sources. State the conflict and use
whichever source has higher precedence. When the conflict affects data safety,
security, compatibility, or public behavior, stop before destructive action and
request a decision unless the user has already provided one.

Treat these as authoritative repository facts when present:

- `Cargo.toml` and workspace manifests;
- `Cargo.lock`;
- `rust-toolchain.toml` or `rust-toolchain`;
- `.cargo/config.toml`;
- `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`;
- architecture decision records under `docs/adr/` or equivalent;
- checked-in API specifications and database migrations;
- CI workflows and release scripts;
- package-manager lockfiles for any frontend;
- existing automated tests.

Do not edit generated files directly when a generator or source definition
exists. Change the source and regenerate the outputs using the repository's
normal workflow.

---

## 3. Non-Negotiable Operating Rules

1. Inspect before editing. Never modify unfamiliar code based only on filenames
   or assumptions.
2. Solve the requested problem, not an imagined larger problem.
3. Prefer the smallest coherent change that fixes the root cause.
4. Preserve existing behavior unless the user requests a behavior change or the
   existing behavior is demonstrably unsafe or incorrect.
5. Do not perform unrelated refactors in the same change.
6. Never fabricate successful builds, test results, benchmarks, file contents,
   source citations, or security findings.
7. Never hide a failing command. Fix it or report the exact failure and its
   impact.
8. Do not weaken tests, lints, security controls, type checks, or CI gates merely
   to make a change pass.
9. Never expose, print, commit, or copy secrets, tokens, credentials, private
   keys, production data, or personal data.
10. Do not execute destructive commands, reset user work, rewrite Git history,
    delete databases, remove migrations, or alter production resources without
    explicit authorization.
11. Do not install global tools, change the operating system, or upgrade the
    repository toolchain without authorization. Repository-local dependencies
    may be added only when justified by the task.
12. Do not use network access, external services, or production endpoints in
    tests unless explicitly authorized and safely isolated.
13. Do not claim a security issue without concrete evidence. Distinguish a
    confirmed defect from a suspected risk or an unverified assumption.
14. Never mark work complete until the relevant verification commands have been
    run or their inability to run has been documented.
15. Keep user-visible status updates concise and useful during long tasks.
16. Limit parallel delegation to a maximum of five sub-agents per task. Do not
    create additional sub-agents unless explicitly authorized by the user,
    because excessive delegation can consume unnecessary tokens and increase
    cost without improving the result. Every sub-agent must use the same model
    as the primary agent: if the primary agent is running Opus, all sub-agents
    must run Opus; if it is running Fable, all sub-agents must run Fable. Do not
    silently downgrade, upgrade, or mix models between the primary agent and its
    sub-agents.

---

## 4. Select the Correct Work Mode

Before acting, classify the task. Use one primary mode and add another only when
necessary.

### Mode A — Greenfield Application

Use when creating a new application, crate, service, desktop app, workspace, or
major subsystem from scratch.

Required behavior:

- establish the requirements and boundaries before selecting frameworks;
- choose the simplest architecture that satisfies the known requirements;
- create a working vertical slice early;
- add safety, tests, CI, documentation, and packaging as part of the design;
- avoid speculative infrastructure and premature abstractions.

### Mode B — Existing Application Change

Use for features, enhancements, refactoring, dependency changes, configuration
changes, or UI changes in an existing repository.

Required behavior:

- discover the existing architecture and conventions first;
- identify public contracts and compatibility requirements;
- make a narrow, reviewable change;
- add or update tests that prove the requested behavior;
- review the final diff for accidental changes.

### Mode C — Bug Fix or Incident

Use when behavior is broken, intermittent, unsafe, or causing an operational
incident.

Required behavior:

- reproduce or otherwise establish evidence of the defect;
- identify the root cause, not only the visible symptom;
- assess blast radius and data impact;
- implement the smallest safe fix;
- add a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after it;
- document any repair, migration, rollback, or operational action.

### Mode D — Audit Only

Use when the user requests a review, audit, security assessment, architecture
assessment, test assessment, or report without requesting implementation.

Required behavior:

- remain read-only;
- inspect the full relevant scope;
- cite real `file:line` evidence for every finding;
- create `plans/auditor.md` and `plans/fixes.md` when the audit is repository-wide;
- do not implement fixes until explicitly instructed.

### Mode E — Fix Plan Execution

Use when the user asks to implement an existing audit or fix plan.

Required behavior:

- execute the plan wave by wave;
- update the completion section for each wave before starting the next;
- keep the audit findings and fix statuses synchronized;
- never mark a wave complete when tests failed or planned work remains.

### Mode F — Release or Production Readiness

Use when preparing a release, package, deployment, migration, or production
rollout.

Required behavior:

- verify reproducible builds, configuration, migrations, security, tests,
  artifacts, versioning, rollback, and operational readiness;
- never treat a debug build or development configuration as production-ready;
- record unresolved release risks explicitly.

### Task Size and Planning Depth

- **Trivial change:** inspect the affected area, edit, run focused checks, review
  the diff, report.
- **Moderate change:** write a concise implementation plan in the conversation or
  `plans/current.md`, then implement and verify.
- **Large, cross-cutting, risky, or multi-stage change:** create or update
  `plans/current.md` with scope, assumptions, affected components, ordered tasks,
  tests, migration/rollback considerations, and completion status.
- **Audit-only task:** use the dedicated audit outputs described later.

Do not force a full-repository audit for a small local change. Increase the
review depth according to security impact, data impact, compatibility risk, and
blast radius.

---

## 5. Mandatory Repository Discovery

Before making changes, build an accurate repository map. Start with targeted
inspection rather than reading every file indiscriminately.

### 5.1 Inspect Repository Structure

Identify, when present:

- Cargo workspace root and member crates;
- binary and library entrypoints;
- domain, application, infrastructure, interface, and UI boundaries;
- backend route definitions and middleware;
- desktop commands, IPC boundaries, capabilities, and permissions;
- frontend entrypoints, package manager, and build tooling;
- database adapters, migrations, and schema files;
- configuration loading and environment-variable handling;
- authentication, authorization, session, and token code;
- external HTTP clients and third-party integrations;
- file-system access and process execution;
- background jobs and schedulers;
- tests, fixtures, examples, benches, and fuzz targets;
- CI, containers, packaging, systemd, reverse proxy, and deployment files;
- generated code and its source generator.

### 5.2 Read the Governing Files

Read the relevant parts of:

```text
AGENTS.md
README.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
SECURITY.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
CHANGELOG.md
Cargo.toml
Cargo.lock
rust-toolchain.toml
rust-toolchain
.cargo/config.toml
deny.toml
clippy.toml
rustfmt.toml
.env.example
Dockerfile*
docker-compose*.yml
.github/workflows/*
package.json
pnpm-lock.yaml
yarn.lock
package-lock.json
bun.lock*
tauri.conf.json
capabilities/*.json
migrations/*
```


### 5.3 Establish Repository Facts

Before implementation, determine and retain:

- project type and user-facing purpose;
- supported operating systems and architectures;
- Rust edition, pinned toolchain, and MSRV;
- workspace members and dependency direction;
- enabled and mutually exclusive Cargo features;
- runtime framework and async executor;
- frontend framework and package manager;
- database engine and migration tool;
- authentication/session model;
- external services and trust boundaries;
- build, test, lint, package, and run commands;
- release and deployment path;
- compatibility constraints and public APIs.

If a fact cannot be verified, label it as unknown. Do not replace unknowns with
assumptions.

### 5.4 Inspect Current Working State

When Git is available:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff --check
```

Preserve pre-existing user changes. Do not overwrite, revert, stage, commit, or
reformat unrelated work. At the end, distinguish your changes from changes that
already existed.

---

## 6. Greenfield Application Protocol

Apply this section only in Mode A.

### 6.1 Define the Product Before the Stack

Establish:

- the users and primary workflows;
- required inputs and outputs;
- local-only versus networked operation;
- data sensitivity and retention requirements;
- authentication and authorization requirements;
- expected scale, latency, throughput, and availability;
- target operating systems and packaging formats;
- offline behavior and failure behavior;
- external APIs, hardware, or system integrations;
- update, migration, backup, and rollback expectations.

Do not choose Tauri, GTK, Axum, SQLx, Tokio, React, or any other framework merely
because it is familiar. Select technology based on verified requirements and
maintenance cost.

### 6.2 Architecture Decision

Use the least complex structure that preserves clear boundaries.

A single package is preferred when one package is sufficient. Use a workspace
when there are independently testable or reusable components, multiple binaries,
separate delivery surfaces, or a meaningful need for dependency isolation.

For a multi-surface application, a suitable starting point may be:

```text
Cargo.toml                 # workspace manifest
crates/
  domain/                  # pure business rules and domain types
  application/             # use cases and ports
  infrastructure/          # database, filesystem, network implementations
apps/
  server/                  # HTTP/server composition root
  desktop/                 # desktop composition root and IPC layer
frontend/                  # Web UI when applicable
docs/
  architecture.md
  adr/
tests/                     # repository-level integration tests when useful
```

This is a pattern, not a mandate. Do not create crates that contain only one thin
wrapper or abstractions with no current consumer.

Dependency direction should normally point inward:

```text
interfaces -> application -> domain
infrastructure -> application/domain
composition roots wire implementations to interfaces
```

Domain code should not depend directly on HTTP frameworks, UI frameworks,
database clients, logging implementations, or operating-system details unless
those concerns are intrinsic to the domain.

### 6.3 Greenfield Baseline

Create the following when applicable:

- explicit Rust edition and `rust-version`/MSRV;
- `rust-toolchain.toml` when reproducibility requires a pinned toolchain;
- committed `Cargo.lock` unless the user has a documented reason not to;
- repository `.gitignore`;
- README with setup, run, test, and build instructions;
- `.env.example` containing names and safe examples, never real secrets;
- structured configuration with startup validation;
- a tracing/logging baseline with secret redaction;
- unit and integration test structure;
- CI for formatting, linting, testing, and locked builds;
- dependency/security policy such as `deny.toml` when appropriate;
- license and package metadata when distribution is intended;
- health checks and graceful shutdown for long-running services;
- packaging configuration for deliverable applications;
- architecture documentation for non-trivial systems.

Do not add tools merely to satisfy a checklist. Every tool must have a documented
purpose and a command that can run successfully.

### 6.4 Build in Vertical Slices

For each major capability:

1. define the externally observable behavior;
2. model the domain and failure cases;
3. define narrow interfaces at actual boundaries;
4. implement the simplest end-to-end path;
5. add automated tests;
6. validate security and operational behavior;
7. document configuration and usage;
8. only then generalize repeated patterns.

Do not build a large generic framework before the first working user flow.

---

## 7. Existing Application Change Protocol

Apply this section in Modes B and C.

### 7.1 Understand Before Changing

For the requested behavior:

- locate the entrypoint and full call path;
- identify data flow, side effects, and trust boundaries;
- inspect related tests and documentation;
- identify public APIs, serialized formats, database schemas, configuration keys,
  CLI flags, IPC commands, UI behavior, and deployment assumptions;
- search for all call sites before changing a shared symbol;
- inspect version history only when it materially helps explain intent.

### 7.2 Reproduce or Establish Evidence

For defects, prefer one of:

- a failing automated test;
- a deterministic local reproduction;
- a concrete trace through the code;
- logs or error output supplied by the user;
- a static proof for security or correctness defects.

Do not claim a root cause from correlation alone.

### 7.3 Assess Change Impact

Before editing, determine whether the change affects:

- stored data or migrations;
- authentication or authorization;
- public HTTP/IPC/CLI interfaces;
- configuration compatibility;
- cross-platform behavior;
- concurrency, cancellation, or shutdown;
- packaging and deployment;
- external integrations;
- performance-critical paths;
- generated clients or schemas.

For high-impact changes, define migration and rollback behavior before
implementation.

### 7.4 Implement a Focused Change

- Fix the root cause.
- Keep unrelated formatting and renaming out of the diff.
- Reuse established safe abstractions.
- Do not preserve an unsafe pattern merely for visual consistency.
- Do not introduce a new dependency for functionality that is simple and safe to
  implement with the standard library or existing dependencies.
- Do not rewrite a stable subsystem unless a targeted fix cannot safely solve the
  problem and the rewrite is justified.

### 7.5 Prove the Change

At minimum:

- add or update a test for the requested behavior;
- add a regression test for a bug or security fix;
- run the narrowest relevant test first;
- run repository-level quality gates appropriate to the blast radius;
- inspect `git diff` and `git diff --check`;
- verify documentation and examples remain accurate.

---

## 8. Rust Design and Coding Standards

### 8.1 Toolchain, Edition, and MSRV

- Respect the repository's pinned toolchain and declared MSRV.
- Do not upgrade the Rust edition, MSRV, or toolchain as a side effect of another
  task.
- For a new project, use a currently supported stable edition and declare an MSRV
  intentionally.
- Test MSRV in CI when the project promises one.
- Avoid nightly features unless they are an explicit project requirement.

### 8.2 API and Type Design

- Make invalid states difficult to represent.
- Prefer domain types and validated newtypes over raw strings and integers for
  identifiers, URLs, paths, quantities, states, and security-sensitive values.
- Keep public APIs small and intentional.
- Use visibility boundaries (`pub(crate)`, private modules) instead of exposing
  implementation details.
- Prefer concrete types until multiple real implementations justify a trait.
- Add traits at architectural boundaries, not around every struct.
- Avoid `dyn Trait` and generics when a simpler concrete design is clearer.
- Avoid stringly typed state machines; use enums with exhaustive matching.
- Preserve forward/backward compatibility for serialized public formats.
- Use `#[non_exhaustive]` only when it serves a real compatibility contract.
- Document invariants, units, ownership, thread-safety, and failure behavior.

### 8.3 Ownership and Allocation

- Prefer borrowing when it improves clarity and avoids unnecessary allocation.
- Do not introduce difficult lifetime designs solely to eliminate insignificant
  clones.
- Avoid habitual `.clone()`; determine ownership deliberately.
- Use `Cow` only when both borrowed and owned behavior are genuinely useful.
- Avoid collecting an iterator when streaming or direct iteration is simpler.
- Do not optimize allocation without evidence in non-critical code.

### 8.4 Error Handling

- Use `Result` for recoverable failures.
- Use domain-specific error types where callers need to distinguish failure
  categories.
- `thiserror` is appropriate for typed library/application errors when already
  present or justified.
- `anyhow` or equivalent context-rich errors are appropriate at application and
  composition boundaries, not as a replacement for meaningful public error
  contracts.
- Add context at boundaries: operation, resource, and safe identifiers.
- Preserve the original source error when useful.
- Map internal errors to safe UI/API errors without leaking secrets, SQL, paths,
  stack traces, tokens, or implementation details.
- Log an error at the layer that owns the operational response; avoid logging the
  same error repeatedly at every propagation layer.

Production code rules:

- Do not use `unwrap()` or `expect()` on user input, network data, database data,
  configuration, filesystem state, lock acquisition, parsing, or request paths.
- Do not use `panic!()`, `todo!()`, or `unimplemented!()` in reachable production
  paths.
- An `expect()` may be acceptable for a compile-time or locally proven invariant
  when the invariant is obvious, documented, and cannot be invalidated by runtime
  input. Include a precise message.
- `unwrap()`/`expect()` are acceptable in tests when they improve readability and
  the failure itself is the desired test failure.
- Avoid empty `Err(_) => {}` branches and error suppression.

### 8.5 Unsafe Rust and FFI

Default policy: safe Rust.

- Use `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` or workspace lint policy when the project does not
  require unsafe code.
- When unsafe code is necessary, minimize its surface and isolate it behind a safe
  API.
- Every unsafe block must have a nearby `SAFETY:` comment describing the exact
  invariant that makes the operation valid.
- Enable `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` and do not treat an `unsafe fn` body as an
  implicit unsafe block.
- Validate pointers, lengths, alignment, lifetimes, ownership transfer, aliasing,
  thread constraints, ABI, and cleanup at FFI boundaries.
- Define who allocates and who frees every foreign resource.
- Test failure paths and platform differences.
- Use Miri, sanitizers, or targeted fuzzing when practical for unsafe code.
- A high unsafe-code count is a review signal, not proof of a vulnerability.

### 8.6 Serialization and Parsing

- Treat all external data as untrusted.
- Validate size before expensive parsing or allocation.
- Use bounded collections and depth limits where parsers support them.
- Validate semantic constraints after deserialization.
- Avoid untagged or highly ambiguous formats for security-sensitive protocols.
- Use strict unknown-field rejection only when it does not break required forward
  compatibility.
- Do not deserialize untrusted data into types that trigger side effects.
- Never use unsafe native deserialization or `eval`-like behavior.
- Make units, time zones, numeric ranges, and encoding explicit.

### 8.7 Filesystem and Path Handling

- Treat paths from users, archives, URLs, APIs, or configuration as untrusted.
- Prevent path traversal and absolute-path escape.
- Resolve and validate containment against an allowed root when containment is a
  security boundary.
- Be aware of symlink and time-of-check/time-of-use races.
- Use secure temporary files and atomic replacement when writing important files.
- Set restrictive permissions for secrets and sensitive data.
- Do not recursively delete a computed path without strong validation.
- Validate archive entries before extraction; reject traversal, absolute paths,
  device files, and unsafe links.
- Bound upload size and validate actual content, not only file extension or MIME
  metadata.

### 8.8 Process Execution

- Avoid spawning external commands when a maintained library API is appropriate.
- Never invoke a shell with concatenated untrusted input.
- Pass arguments as separate `Command::arg` values.
- Validate executable paths and allowed operations.
- Define timeouts, output limits, environment, working directory, privileges, and
  exit-status handling.
- Do not inherit secrets or an uncontrolled environment unnecessarily.
- Prevent child-process leaks and zombie processes.

### 8.9 Integer and Numeric Safety

- Validate conversions between signed/unsigned and differently sized integers.
- Use checked, saturating, or explicitly wrapping arithmetic according to domain
  semantics.
- Do not rely on debug-only overflow checks.
- Validate lengths before allocation and multiplication.
- Avoid floating-point arithmetic for exact quantities such as monetary values.
- Define rounding rules and units explicitly.

### 8.10 Time and Randomness

- Use cryptographically secure randomness for secrets, tokens, session IDs,
  reset links, nonces, and security identifiers.
- Do not use timestamps, counters, `rand` defaults, UUID versions without adequate
  entropy, or `uniqid`-style values as secrets.
- Store instants and timestamps using types appropriate to their semantics.
- Use UTC internally when possible and convert explicitly at interfaces.
- Do not use wall-clock time for measuring durations; use a monotonic clock.
- Make time and randomness injectable or controllable in deterministic tests.

### 8.11 Module Organization

- Keep binaries and framework entrypoints thin.
- Avoid god modules, god structs, and `utils.rs` dumping grounds.
- Group code by cohesive responsibility rather than arbitrary technical labels
  when domain grouping is clearer.
- Keep cyclic conceptual dependencies out of the design even if Rust modules can
  technically reference each other.
- Remove dead code only after proving it is unused and not part of a public or
  plugin interface.
- Prefer explicit imports and meaningful names over clever brevity.

### 8.12 Documentation

- Public APIs should explain purpose, invariants, errors, panics, safety, and
  examples where useful.
- Keep comments focused on why and constraints, not a restatement of the code.
- Documentation examples should compile as doctests when practical.
- Update user and operator documentation in the same change as behavior or
  configuration.

---

## 9. Async, Concurrency, and Resource Safety

Apply when the application uses async code, threads, shared state, or background
workers.

### 9.1 Async Runtime

- Use the runtime already selected by the repository.
- Do not create nested runtimes casually.
- Do not perform blocking filesystem, CPU-heavy, database, compression,
  cryptographic, or process operations on an async executor thread.
- Use the runtime's blocking facility, a dedicated worker, or an async-capable
  API as appropriate.
- Add timeouts to external I/O and operations that can wait indefinitely.
- Propagate cancellation and define what happens to partial work.
- Do not detach critical tasks without ownership, error reporting, and shutdown
  behavior.
- Use bounded queues/channels and explicit backpressure.
- Avoid unbounded task spawning.

### 9.2 Locks and Shared State

- Prefer ownership transfer and message passing over global mutable state.
- Do not hold a synchronous or async lock across `.await` unless it is explicitly
  designed and proven safe.
- Keep critical sections small.
- Define lock ordering when multiple locks can be acquired.
- Handle poisoned locks deliberately when using standard-library locks.
- Avoid `Arc<Mutex<_>>` as a reflex; choose concurrency primitives based on access
  patterns.
- Review for deadlocks, starvation, race conditions, lost updates, and check-then-
  act bugs.

### 9.3 Shutdown and Cleanup

- Long-running services must support graceful shutdown.
- Stop accepting new work, drain or cancel existing work according to policy, and
  close resources in a defined order.
- Ensure spawned tasks, processes, temporary files, sockets, transactions, and
  locks are cleaned up on normal failure paths.
- Avoid cleanup that depends solely on `Drop` when an explicit async close/flush
  is required.

### 9.4 Performance

- Correctness and safety come before micro-optimization.
- Measure before optimizing.
- Use realistic benchmarks or tracing for performance claims.
- Look for N+1 operations, repeated parsing, unnecessary cloning, excessive
  allocations, lock contention, unbounded buffering, synchronous work in async
  paths, and full-collection loading.
- Set explicit resource limits for attacker-controlled workloads.
- Document deliberate performance tradeoffs.

---

## 10. Security Engineering Baseline

Apply security review proportionally to the application's exposure and data.
Internet-facing, multi-user, privileged, or update-capable software requires a
full threat-oriented review.

### 10.1 Trust Boundaries and Threat Model

Identify:

- users, roles, tenants, services, and administrators;
- local versus remote attackers;
- privileged processes and operating-system capabilities;
- browser/WebView, backend, database, filesystem, IPC, and external-service
  boundaries;
- sensitive assets and personal data;
- data flows, entrypoints, and side effects;
- abuse cases and denial-of-service vectors.

For substantial systems, document the threat model in `docs/security.md` or the
repository's established location.

### 10.2 Authentication and Authorization

- Authentication proves identity; authorization must be checked separately for
  every protected action and resource.
- Enforce authorization server-side or in the trusted Rust process, never only in
  the UI.
- Check ownership, tenant, shop, organization, or scope at the data-access
  boundary as well as route boundaries when appropriate.
- Prevent IDOR/BOLA by deriving scope from the authenticated principal rather than
  trusting IDs supplied by the client.
- Use least privilege and deny by default.
- Protect administrative, debug, maintenance, import/export, and background-job
  endpoints.
- Invalidate sessions/tokens appropriately after password, role, or account
  security changes.
- Use constant-time comparison for secrets where required.
- Do not implement cryptographic protocols manually.

### 10.3 Input Validation and Output Safety

- Validate type, length, range, format, allowed values, encoding, and semantic
  relationships at trusted boundaries.
- Client-side validation is UX only; repeat validation in trusted code.
- Encode output for its destination context.
- Avoid raw HTML injection and unsafe templating escapes.
- Normalize filenames, URLs, hostnames, and identifiers only with a clear policy;
  avoid validation-before-normalization inconsistencies.

### 10.4 Database Safety

- Use parameterized queries or safe query builders.
- Never concatenate untrusted input into SQL.
- Whitelist dynamic identifiers such as sort fields; bind values cannot safely
  replace identifiers.
- Use transactions for multi-step invariants.
- Enforce important invariants with database constraints as well as application
  checks.
- Review isolation and lost-update behavior for concurrent writes.
- Scope queries by tenant/user/shop where applicable.
- Avoid returning database errors to clients.
- Add indexes based on verified query patterns, not guesswork.

### 10.5 HTTP and API Security

- Enforce authentication and authorization on every protected route.
- Set request-body, upload, header, and decompression limits.
- Use timeouts and connection limits.
- Add rate limiting to authentication, expensive, state-changing, and abuse-prone
  endpoints when relevant.
- Configure CORS narrowly. Never combine arbitrary origins with credentials.
- Protect cookie-authenticated state-changing requests against CSRF.
- Use secure cookie attributes: `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, appropriate `SameSite`,
  narrow path/domain, and bounded lifetime.
- Return correct status codes and a consistent safe error shape.
- Do not expose stack traces, database details, filesystem paths, secrets, or
  internal topology.
- Use pagination and maximum page sizes for collections.
- Consider idempotency and replay protection for retryable sensitive operations.
- Validate outbound URLs and block unsafe destinations when SSRF is possible.

### 10.6 Secrets and Configuration

- Load secrets from an approved secret source or runtime environment.
- Never store real credentials in source, examples, logs, fixtures, screenshots,
  frontend bundles, desktop WebViews, or error messages.
- Validate required configuration at startup and fail safely with an actionable
  but non-secret error.
- Separate development defaults from production requirements.
- Bind network listeners safely; do not expose services publicly by accident.
- Document every environment variable, whether required, and its safe behavior.

### 10.7 Logging and Privacy

- Use structured logs and appropriate levels.
- Redact passwords, tokens, cookies, authorization headers, API keys, database
  URLs, personal data, and sensitive request/response bodies.
- Avoid logging entire domain objects by default.
- Add correlation/request IDs where useful.
- Security/audit logs must be tamper-aware, access-controlled, and must not become
  a second sensitive-data store.

### 10.8 Cryptography

- Use well-maintained libraries and established constructions.
- Use password hashing designed for passwords with appropriate parameters.
- Use authenticated encryption where confidentiality and integrity are required.
- Use secure random nonces and never reuse them where prohibited.
- Support key rotation when persistent encrypted data or long-lived tokens are
  involved.
- Never invent encryption, token signing, password storage, or key derivation.

### 10.9 Denial of Service

Review:

- unbounded input, collections, queues, recursion, parsing, and decompression;
- expensive regexes and algorithmic complexity;
- unlimited concurrency and task creation;
- missing timeouts;
- large error/log amplification;
- repeated external calls;
- memory and disk exhaustion;
- lock contention and starvation;
- unauthenticated expensive endpoints.

---

## 11. API and Service Standards

Apply when the repository exposes HTTP, RPC, WebSocket, GraphQL, or other network
interfaces.

- Keep transport DTOs separate from domain models when their contracts differ.
- Validate at the boundary, then convert into validated domain types.
- Keep handlers thin: authenticate, authorize, validate, invoke a use case, map
  the result.
- Centralize safe error mapping.
- Use consistent response and error schemas.
- Do not return internal structs merely because they serialize.
- Avoid breaking fields, enum variants, status codes, or semantics without a
  versioning/migration plan.
- Define pagination, filtering, sorting, and maximum result sizes.
- Define idempotency for operations likely to be retried.
- Bound WebSocket messages and connection lifetime; authenticate upgrades and
  re-check authorization for channel/topic access.
- Validate webhook signatures, timestamps, replay windows, body limits, and
  response behavior.
- Use explicit connect, read, write, and total timeouts for outbound clients.
- Avoid automatic redirects to untrusted destinations when they can cross trust
  boundaries.
- Minimize outbound credentials and scope them per integration.

For OpenAPI or another checked-in schema:

- treat the schema as a contract;
- update schema and implementation together;
- regenerate generated clients/servers rather than hand-editing them;
- add contract tests when practical.

---

## 12. Database and Migration Standards

- Inspect all existing migrations before changing schema.
- Never edit an already-applied migration in a deployed project unless the
  repository explicitly uses mutable migrations and the user authorizes it.
- Add a new migration for schema evolution.
- Make migrations deterministic and review transactional behavior.
- Separate schema migration from large data backfills when operational safety
  requires it.
- Consider old and new application versions during rolling deployment.
- Add constraints, defaults, and indexes deliberately.
- Test migration from a representative previous schema, not only a fresh database.
- Document backup, rollback, and irreversibility for destructive changes.
- Do not drop columns/tables or rewrite large datasets without explicit approval.
- Use least-privilege database credentials in production.
- Never include production data in fixtures or test snapshots.

---

## 13. Web UI Standards

Apply when a Web UI or WebView frontend exists.

### 13.1 Security

- Treat all backend and external values as untrusted.
- Do not use `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, raw template output, `eval`,
  or dynamic code generation with untrusted data.
- If rich HTML is required, use an established sanitizer with a narrow allowlist
  and test bypass cases.
- Do not place long-lived sensitive tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
  when a safer session design is possible.
- Do not embed secrets in frontend environment variables or bundles.
- Do not rely on hidden controls or routes for authorization.
- Protect against CSRF according to the session model.
- Avoid logging sensitive API data to the browser console.
- Set or document appropriate CSP and other browser security headers for deployed
  Web UIs.

### 13.2 Correctness and UX

Every asynchronous view must define:

- loading state;
- empty state;
- success state;
- recoverable error state;
- permission/authentication state;
- retry or recovery behavior where appropriate.

Forms must:

- use visible labels;
- provide field-specific validation feedback;
- preserve safe user input after recoverable errors;
- prevent accidental duplicate submissions;
- clearly distinguish destructive actions;
- request confirmation for irreversible actions;
- never display a false success before the backend commits the operation.

### 13.3 Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML before ARIA.
- Support keyboard navigation and visible focus.
- Ensure dialogs manage focus and can be dismissed appropriately.
- Associate labels, help text, and errors with controls.
- Provide accessible names for icon-only controls.
- Do not communicate state by color alone.
- Respect reduced-motion settings.
- Test key workflows with keyboard-only navigation and an accessibility checker
  when available.

### 13.4 Frontend Tooling

Detect the package manager from the lockfile and use only that manager. Do not
create a second lockfile.

Common commands must be adapted to repository scripts, for example:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test
pnpm run build
pnpm audit
```

Use the equivalent `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun` commands only when that is the existing
package manager. Do not run an automatic dependency-fix command that performs
major upgrades without reviewing the resulting changes.

---

## 14. Desktop Application Standards

Apply when Tauri, GTK/libadwaita, Iced, Slint, or another desktop framework is
present.

### 14.1 Desktop Architecture

- Keep domain and application logic outside widget/controller code.
- Keep the UI thread responsive.
- Move blocking and expensive work to appropriate workers.
- Make cancellation, progress, retry, and failure visible to the user.
- Do not expose privileged operations directly to untrusted WebView/UI input.
- Treat local IPC as a security boundary when a renderer or plugin can be
  compromised.

### 14.2 Tauri and WebView

- Minimize commands exposed to the frontend.
- Validate every command argument in Rust.
- Apply least-privilege capabilities and permissions.
- Do not enable broad shell, filesystem, URL, or process access without a verified
  requirement.
- Restrict file access to intentional roots and operations.
- Review deep links, custom protocols, updater configuration, CSP, remote content,
  and navigation permissions.
- Do not load arbitrary remote content in a privileged WebView.
- Sign update artifacts and verify the updater trust chain when updates are used.
- Never return secrets or unrestricted filesystem paths to the frontend.

### 14.3 GTK/libadwaita and Native UI

- Follow the toolkit's ownership and main-thread rules.
- Avoid blocking callbacks.
- Disconnect signals and release resources correctly.
- Preserve accessibility metadata and keyboard behavior.
- Follow platform conventions unless the product intentionally defines a custom
  design system.
- Test light/dark themes, localization expansion, high-DPI scaling, and narrow
  window sizes when supported.

### 14.4 Desktop Packaging

Review:

- application ID and display metadata;
- icons and desktop integration;
- runtime dependencies;
- sandbox/portal behavior;
- filesystem locations for config, cache, state, and logs;
- code signing and update signing;
- RPM/DEB/AppImage/Flatpak/MSI/DMG configuration as applicable;
- clean install, upgrade, downgrade/rollback policy, and uninstall behavior.

Do not claim platform support that has not been built or tested.

---

## 15. CLI Standards

Apply when a command-line interface exists.

- Keep stdout for intended program output and stderr for diagnostics.
- Use stable, documented exit codes.
- Do not print secrets or sensitive defaults.
- Support non-interactive execution where automation is expected.
- Validate paths and destructive operations.
- Provide `--help` and meaningful errors.
- Avoid breaking flag names or output formats without a compatibility plan.
- Make machine-readable output explicit, stable, and free from unrelated logs.
- Handle Ctrl-C and termination safely for long-running commands.

---

## 16. Configuration and Environment

- Use one documented configuration precedence order.
- Validate configuration once at startup and convert it into typed validated
  values.
- Distinguish missing, malformed, and insecure configuration.
- Do not silently fall back to insecure production defaults.
- Avoid reading environment variables throughout business logic; inject typed
  configuration.
- Keep `.env` files out of version control; provide `.env.example` with safe
  placeholders.
- Avoid compile-time embedding of runtime secrets.
- Document units, allowed values, default behavior, and whether restart is needed.
- Separate config, cache, state, data, and log directories according to platform
  conventions.

---

## 17. Observability and Operational Safety

For services and operationally significant applications:

- use structured tracing/logging;
- define log levels consistently;
- add request/job IDs where they help correlate work;
- expose liveness and readiness separately when relevant;
- verify health checks do not expose secrets or create expensive load;
- provide graceful shutdown;
- record startup configuration safely, without secrets;
- add metrics for throughput, latency, errors, saturation, queue depth, retries,
  and rate limiting where useful;
- make external-call latency and failure visible;
- define log retention and privacy considerations;
- avoid high-cardinality metric labels from user-controlled values;
- ensure diagnostics remain useful in release builds.

An application is not production-ready merely because it compiles and starts.

---

## 18. Dependency and Supply-Chain Policy

### 18.1 Adding Dependencies

Before adding a crate or frontend package, evaluate:

- whether the functionality already exists in the standard library or repository;
- maintenance activity and release history;
- security advisories;
- transitive dependency and compile-time cost;
- unsafe code and native build requirements;
- supported targets and MSRV;
- license compatibility;
- default features and unnecessary feature activation;
- build scripts, proc macros, network behavior, and system dependencies.

Prefer maintained, focused dependencies. Disable unused default features when it
meaningfully reduces attack surface or build cost and does not create fragile
configuration.

Do not use unpinned Git branch dependencies. If a Git dependency is unavoidable,
pin a revision and document why.

### 18.2 Lockfile and Reproducibility

- Treat `Cargo.lock` as Cargo-managed; never hand-edit it.
- Keep it in version control unless repository policy explicitly says otherwise.
- Use `--locked` in CI and release builds where reproducibility is expected.
- Update dependencies deliberately and review `Cargo.lock` changes.
- Do not combine broad dependency upgrades with unrelated feature work.

### 18.3 Security and Policy Tools

Use existing repository configuration first. Recommended tools, when installed
or explicitly authorized:

```bash
cargo audit
cargo deny check
cargo outdated --workspace
cargo machete
cargo geiger --all-features
```

Interpret results correctly:

- `cargo audit` reports known RustSec advisories; determine actual exposure and
  remediation rather than blindly suppressing.
- `cargo deny` enforces the repository's advisory, license, source, and duplicate
  policies.
- `cargo outdated` is informational; newest is not automatically safest.
- `cargo machete` can produce false positives, especially with build scripts,
  proc macros, features, and indirect usage. Verify before removing.
- `cargo geiger` identifies unsafe usage; it does not prove a vulnerability.

If a tool is unavailable, do not fabricate its output. Either use an existing
alternative or report that the check could not be run. Do not globally install
it without authorization.

### 18.4 Build Scripts and Native Code

Review every `build.rs` and native dependency for:

- filesystem writes outside `OUT_DIR`;
- unnecessary rebuild triggers;
- shell/process execution;
- downloaded artifacts or network access;
- target-versus-host confusion during cross-compilation;
- unpinned generated inputs;
- native compiler/linker assumptions;
- environment and secret leakage.

Build scripts should emit precise `rerun-if-changed` and `rerun-if-env-changed`
instructions where appropriate.

---

## 19. Testing Strategy

Tests are part of the implementation, not optional cleanup.

### 19.1 Required Test Layers

Use the layers relevant to the change:

- **Unit tests:** pure domain rules, validation, transformations, and error paths.
- **Integration tests:** crate boundaries, database adapters, filesystem behavior,
  external-client behavior through fakes/test servers, and configuration.
- **API tests:** authentication, authorization, validation, success, errors,
  limits, and status codes.
- **UI/component tests:** rendering, interactions, validation, loading/error
  states, and accessibility.
- **End-to-end tests:** critical user workflows across real boundaries.
- **Regression tests:** every confirmed bug and security finding.
- **Property-based tests:** parsers, state machines, invariant-heavy logic, and
  large input spaces.
- **Fuzz tests:** parsers, decoders, archive/file handling, protocol boundaries,
  unsafe code, and complex untrusted input.
- **Benchmarks:** only for measured performance-sensitive behavior.
- **Doctests:** public API examples where practical.

### 19.2 Test Quality

Tests must be:

- deterministic and isolated;
- explicit about the behavior they prove;
- independent of execution order;
- free from real production services and data;
- bounded by timeouts where hangs are possible;
- able to clean up temporary state;
- resistant to false success from overly broad mocks.

Prefer testing public behavior over private implementation. Do not make production
APIs public solely to test internals.

### 19.3 Security Regression Coverage

For security fixes, include negative tests for:

- unauthenticated access;
- authenticated but unauthorized access;
- cross-user or cross-tenant IDs;
- malformed and oversized input;
- path traversal and unsafe filenames;
- injection attempts;
- CSRF/CORS/session behavior when applicable;
- replay and duplicate submission when applicable;
- error-message leakage;
- rate and resource limits.

### 19.4 Database Tests

- Run tests against the actual database engine when behavior depends on it.
- Test fresh migrations and upgrade migrations.
- Test transaction rollback and constraint violations.
- Avoid asserting only mocked SQL strings when real behavior matters.

### 19.5 Test Failures

Never delete, ignore, loosen, or mark a failing test flaky without proving the
reason. If a pre-existing test fails, document that it predates the change and
assess whether the change is safe despite it.

---

## 20. Quality Gates and Verification Commands

Discover repository-specific commands first. The following is a baseline, not a
blind script.

### 20.1 Focused Development Loop

Run the narrowest relevant checks while implementing, for example:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check -p <affected-package> --all-targets
cargo test -p <affected-package> <relevant_test_name>
cargo clippy -p <affected-package> --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

### 20.2 Standard Rust Workspace Gate

When features are compatible:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
cargo test --workspace --doc --locked
```

If `Cargo.lock` is intentionally absent or the repository is a published-library
workflow that does not use it, omit `--locked` and document why.

If features are mutually exclusive, do not force `--all-features`. Use the
repository's documented feature matrix or test each supported combination. Tools
such as `cargo-hack` may be used only when already configured or authorized.

### 20.3 Release Gate

For release or production-readiness tasks, also run as applicable:

```bash
cargo build --workspace --release --locked
cargo audit
cargo deny check
```

Run package/install/container checks and startup smoke tests defined by the
repository.

### 20.4 Optional Advanced Rust Checks

Use when risk justifies them and the environment supports them:

```bash
cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --all-features
cargo test --workspace --all-features --no-fail-fast
cargo +nightly miri test
cargo fuzz run <target>
```

Do not introduce nightly into the normal project toolchain merely to run an
optional check.

### 20.5 Frontend Gate

Use scripts and the package manager present in the repository. Typical checks:

```bash
<pm> run lint
<pm> run typecheck
<pm> run test
<pm> run build
<pm> audit
```

### 20.6 Verification Discipline

- Run formatting checks after editing.
- Run focused tests before broad tests.
- Run all checks affected by changed features and targets.
- Do not claim cross-platform verification when only one target was tested.
- Do not claim a production build is safe without testing the release path.
- Record the exact commands and outcomes in the final report.

---

## 21. CI/CD and Release Engineering

### 21.1 CI Baseline

A maintained project should normally verify:

- formatting;
- compilation/check across relevant targets and features;
- Clippy with warnings denied;
- unit, integration, and doctests;
- frontend lint/typecheck/test/build when present;
- locked dependency resolution;
- security/license/source policies;
- MSRV when promised;
- release build or package construction;
- migration tests when schema changes matter.

Pin third-party CI actions to trusted versions or immutable revisions according
to repository policy. Grant workflows minimum permissions. Do not expose secrets
to untrusted pull-request code.

### 21.2 Release Readiness

Before release, verify:

- version numbers and changelog;
- reproducible release build;
- artifact contents and checksums;
- signing/notarization/updater metadata where applicable;
- clean install and upgrade path;
- database migration and rollback plan;
- environment-variable and secret requirements;
- default bind addresses and exposed ports;
- production logging and error behavior;
- health checks and graceful shutdown;
- license notices and dependency policy;
- known issues and unresolved findings.

Do not bump a version, create a tag, publish a crate, upload an artifact, deploy,
or push without explicit authorization.

### 21.3 Containers and Deployment

Review:

- minimal trusted base image;
- pinned image versions/digests when required;
- non-root runtime user;
- no secrets baked into layers;
- multi-stage build and minimal runtime contents;
- read-only filesystem where practical;
- dropped Linux capabilities;
- explicit ports and bind addresses;
- health checks;
- resource limits;
- signal handling and graceful shutdown;
- TLS/reverse-proxy assumptions;
- file ownership and permissions;
- `.dockerignore` coverage.

---

## 22. Documentation and Project Memory

Keep documentation synchronized with the implementation.

For a non-trivial project, maintain as applicable:

```text
README.md                    # purpose, setup, run, test, build
AGENTS.md                    # agent operating instructions
docs/architecture.md         # current architecture and boundaries
docs/security.md             # trust model and security assumptions
docs/adr/                    # durable architecture decisions
CHANGELOG.md                 # user-visible release changes
.env.example                 # safe configuration template
plans/current.md             # active large-task plan, when needed
plans/auditor.md             # repository audit report, audit mode
plans/fixes.md               # staged remediation plan, audit mode
```

When making a durable architectural decision, create or update an ADR containing:

- context;
- decision;
- alternatives considered;
- consequences;
- migration/rollback implications;
- status and date.

Do not use documentation as a substitute for clear code and tests. Do not leave
obsolete plans that appear active; mark status clearly.

---

## 23. Dedicated Audit Protocol

Apply this section only for Mode D or when explicitly requested.

### 23.1 Audit Scope

Inspect the full relevant codebase and configuration, including:

- Rust correctness and panic risks;
- unsafe code and FFI;
- async, concurrency, locking, cancellation, and resource cleanup;
- backend routes, middleware, authentication, authorization, and API boundaries;
- database/storage access and migrations;
- Web UI security, correctness, UX, and accessibility;
- desktop IPC/capabilities and privileged operations;
- file handling, path handling, process execution, and external network calls;
- configuration, secrets, logging, and privacy;
- dependencies, build scripts, supply chain, and licenses;
- CI/CD, containers, packaging, and deployment assumptions;
- tests, coverage gaps, documentation, and observability.

Search for risky patterns, then verify each use in context. Useful search terms
include:

```text
unwrap(
expect(
panic!
todo!
unimplemented!
unsafe
std::process::Command
Command::new
fs::
File::
PathBuf
canonicalize
serde_json::from
serde_yaml
reqwest
hyper
axum
actix
rocket
warp
sqlx
diesel
rusqlite
jsonwebtoken
cookie
session
cors
csrf
password
secret
token
api_key
Authorization
Set-Cookie
Access-Control-Allow-Origin
innerHTML
dangerouslySetInnerHTML
localStorage
sessionStorage
eval(
Function(
```

A search hit is not a finding. Read the surrounding code, call sites, validation,
framework behavior, tests, and configuration before drawing a conclusion.

### 23.2 Evidence Rules

Every finding must include:

- unique ID;
- severity;
- category;
- exact location and affected files;
- concrete description;
- why it matters;
- evidence from real code with `file:line` references;
- exploit/failure scenario when applicable;
- targeted remediation;
- specific regression tests;
- status.

Rules:

- never invent a line number or issue;
- do not inflate severity;
- distinguish confirmed, suspected, and unverified issues;
- do not duplicate the same root cause as multiple findings;
- prioritize exploitable and correctness issues over style;
- state clean areas and limitations;
- state tools or commands that could not run;
- remain read-only until implementation is requested.

### 23.3 Severity Model

**Critical** — credible paths to remote code execution, broad authentication or
authorization bypass, arbitrary file access, major secret extraction, impactful
SQL injection, persistent account-compromising XSS, or production-wide
compromise.

**High** — significant data exposure, privilege escalation, missing authorization
on important operations, serious session flaws, sensitive CSRF, meaningful XSS,
unsafe deserialization, or serious denial of service.

**Medium** — limited exposure, weak validation, missing limits, information
leakage, recoverable denial of service, unsafe defaults, inconsistent controls,
or important test gaps.

**Low** — minor hardening, low-impact correctness/UX/security issues,
configuration improvements, or maintainability risks.

**Informational** — documentation, observability, developer experience, cleanup,
or non-risky design improvements.

Severity must reflect realistic impact, exploitability, exposure, and existing
mitigations.

### 23.4 `plans/auditor.md`

For a repository-wide audit, create `plans/auditor.md` with:

1. Executive Summary
2. Audit Scope and Limitations
3. Methodology
4. Critical Findings
5. High Findings
6. Medium Findings
7. Low Findings
8. Informational Findings
9. Rust-Specific Review
10. Web UI Review, when applicable
11. API Review, when applicable
12. Desktop/IPC Review, when applicable
13. Dependency and Supply-Chain Review
14. Configuration and Deployment Review
15. Testing Review
16. Prioritized Risk Register
17. Recommended Tooling
18. Final Audit Conclusion

Use a consistent finding template and a risk-register table containing ID,
severity, category, finding, affected area, priority, and remediation wave.

### 23.5 `plans/fixes.md`

Create an analytical, executable remediation plan. Keep finding IDs synchronized
with `plans/auditor.md`. Use these waves when applicable:

1. Critical security fixes
2. High-severity fixes
3. Authentication, authorization, and API hardening
4. Rust reliability and error handling
5. Web UI/desktop security, UX, and accessibility
6. Dependency, supply-chain, and build hardening
7. Testing expansion and regression coverage
8. Observability, logging, and operational safety
9. Documentation and developer experience
10. Final verification and release readiness

Each wave must include:

- why it is needed;
- referenced finding IDs;
- exact implementation guidance and likely files/modules;
- compatibility, migration, and rollback concerns;
- tests and commands to run;
- a completion update containing changes, completion status, commands, results,
  remaining issues, blockers, and follow-up work.

Do not implement fixes during audit-only mode.

---

## 24. Fix-Plan Execution Protocol

Apply in Mode E.

For each wave:

1. re-read the relevant audit findings and current code;
2. verify the finding still exists;
3. update the implementation plan if repository facts changed;
4. implement minimal targeted fixes;
5. add or update regression tests;
6. run focused checks, then the required wave checks;
7. review the diff and results;
8. update that wave's completion section immediately;
9. update finding statuses in `plans/auditor.md`;
10. only then begin the next wave.

A wave is complete only when:

- all planned work is complete or explicitly re-scoped with justification;
- relevant tests exist;
- required commands ran successfully, or failures are transparently documented;
- results were reviewed;
- remaining risks and follow-up work are recorded.

Do not mark the overall remediation complete until every wave has a completion
update and final verification has been performed.

---

## 25. Change Review Checklist

Before finishing any implementation task, review the actual diff.

### Scope

- Does the diff contain only intentional changes?
- Were user changes preserved?
- Is the root cause fixed?
- Is there unnecessary refactoring or generated noise?

### Correctness

- Are success and failure paths handled?
- Are invariants represented and enforced?
- Are edge cases, null/empty values, overflow, Unicode, time, and platform behavior
  handled where relevant?
- Are async cancellation and cleanup correct?

### Security

- Are all external inputs validated?
- Are authentication and authorization both enforced?
- Are SQL, filesystem, command, URL, and HTML contexts safe?
- Are secrets and sensitive data absent from code, UI, logs, and errors?
- Are size, rate, timeout, and concurrency limits adequate?

### Compatibility

- Are public APIs, serialized data, DB schema, config, CLI, IPC, and UI behavior
  compatible or intentionally migrated?
- Are old and new versions safe during deployment?
- Are platform and feature combinations preserved?

### Tests

- Does a test fail without the fix and pass with it when applicable?
- Are negative/error/authorization paths covered?
- Were focused and broad checks run?
- Were test failures reported honestly?

### Documentation and Operations

- Are setup, config, API, migration, and deployment docs accurate?
- Are logs and diagnostics safe and useful?
- Is rollback or recovery documented for risky changes?

---

## 26. Final Response Contract

At completion, provide a concise but complete report containing:

1. **Outcome** — what was created, changed, fixed, or audited.
2. **Key decisions** — important architecture or compatibility decisions.
3. **Files changed** — grouped by purpose.
4. **Verification** — exact commands run and their results.
5. **Security and data impact** — any relevant risks or migrations.
6. **Limitations** — checks that could not run and why.
7. **Remaining work** — only genuine unresolved items or blockers.

Do not say “all tests pass” unless every claimed test was actually executed and
passed. Do not say “production-ready” unless the applicable release, security,
configuration, migration, packaging, and operational checks have been completed.

---

## 27. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do not:

- redesign the whole repository to implement a local feature;
- create abstractions for hypothetical future use;
- add a trait for every type;
- spread business logic across handlers, widgets, and database code;
- use global mutable state without a strong reason;
- use `Arc<Mutex<_>>` without analyzing access patterns;
- hold locks across `.await` casually;
- perform blocking work on async or UI threads;
- use `unwrap()` as error handling;
- swallow errors or log-and-continue without an explicit recovery policy;
- expose internal errors to users;
- concatenate SQL, shell commands, or paths from untrusted input;
- trust frontend validation or hidden UI controls;
- store secrets in frontend storage or repositories;
- create unbounded queues, tasks, requests, uploads, or result sets;
- update every dependency during an unrelated change;
- enable all crate features without checking whether they are compatible;
- suppress Clippy broadly instead of fixing or narrowly justifying a lint;
- edit generated files by hand;
- modify historical migrations casually;
- delete code based only on a static-tool suggestion;
- optimize without measurement;
- claim cross-platform support without verification;
- claim audit findings without evidence;
- mark incomplete work as complete.

---

## 28. Definition of Done

A task is done only when all applicable conditions are true:

- the requested behavior is implemented or the requested audit is complete;
- the solution matches verified repository architecture and conventions;
- the change is focused and no unrelated work was overwritten;
- errors and edge cases are handled safely;
- security and trust boundaries were reviewed proportionally to risk;
- tests were added or updated where behavior changed;
- relevant formatting, compilation, lint, test, frontend, security, and release
  checks were run;
- migrations/configuration/documentation were updated when necessary;
- the final diff was reviewed;
- failures, limitations, and remaining risks were reported honestly;
- no destructive external action was taken without authorization.

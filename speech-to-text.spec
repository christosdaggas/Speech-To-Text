# The tray rasterises the symbolic SVG through gdk-pixbuf's SVG loader (built
# in since 2.44; older builds get it from librsvg2). Pulled in by gtk4 anyway,
# listed because the tray icon depends on it directly.
Requires:       gdk-pixbuf2
# The binary is built with whisper.cpp's Vulkan GPU backend and links
# libvulkan.so.1 at runtime (used when "Use GPU" is enabled in Settings).
Requires:       vulkan-loader

%description
Speech to Text is made for Fedora with the GNOME desktop, tested on Fedora 44.
Dictate and transcribe audio locally using Whisper, Parakeet or Qwen3-ASR,
with a GTK4/libadwaita interface, searchable history and optional AI text tools.

%changelog
* Fri Oct 23 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1:1.0.0-1
- Reset the application version to 1.0.0; Epoch preserves upgrades from 1.7.x
- Refresh release notes, update checks and Fedora GNOME integration
- Use Fedora's desktop/icon file triggers instead of package scriptlets

* Fri Oct 23 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.7.0-5
- Fixed: a transient Vulkan encode failure no longer pins the session to CPU;
  the take is retried once on GPU, and the status bar reports the backend
  actually loaded
- The main window opens at 1100x680 with the sidebar collapsed by default
- The Recognition and Dictation tab strips use the page surface instead of a
  separate darker background
- The sidebar uses the darker window surface and the right-hand content the
  lighter surface, matching the reference layout
- All right-hand pages share the same content-area background as the home page
- The content header and status bars match that surface, with no horizontal
  borders
- The Dictation settings page opens the desktop's GlobalShortcuts dialog
  directly, and the portal action is labelled "Dictation"
- New application and tray icons

* Thu Oct 22 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.7.0-4
- Updated the application website and bug-report links
- Documentation polish: simplified README, Fedora/GNOME focus

* Sun Oct 18 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.7.0-3
- Fixed: a dictation finishing while the main window was closed could overwrite
  the whole history file when it could not be read or parsed; corrupt files are
  now kept aside and unreadable ones are left untouched
- Fixed: a malformed dropped audio file could leave the window stuck on
  "Decoding file…"; the failure is now reported
- Fixed: hitting the 60-minute recording cap kept a live "Recording" state while
  discarding audio; the recording now ends and what was captured is transcribed
- Fixed: Qwen3-ASR panel dictations were labelled with the Whisper model in
  History; main-window recordings now record the auto-detected language
- Security: rustls 0.23.46 (RUSTSEC-2026-0285/0346/0348/0349) and zip 9.0
  (RUSTSEC-2026-0367/0368/0369), zip built with decoders only

* Thu Aug 20 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.7.0-2
- Fixed: the tray kept showing the previous artwork after the icon was redrawn.
  The tray now rasterises the symbolic SVG at startup instead of shipping
  hand-exported PNGs, so the icon can no longer drift from the source SVG
- Fixed: the desktop's "screen is being shared" indicator sat in the panel from
  login onwards. The RemoteDesktop portal session behind auto-paste is opened on
  the first paste that needs it instead of at startup
- Security: gettext-rs 0.8 (RUSTSEC-2026-0244) and event-listener 5.4.2
  (RUSTSEC-2026-0221), both unsoundness advisories

* Thu Aug 20 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.7.0-1
- Performance: transcription is up to 4x faster on Vulkan GPUs — upgraded
  whisper.cpp engine (1.8.3) uses the GPU's cooperative-matrix cores, plus
  flash attention on GPU contexts
- Added: a Silero voice-activity pre-pass skips silent recordings outright (no
  more hallucinated text from dead air) and trims leading/trailing silence;
  the model ships with the package
- Added: complete Greek, Italian, Spanish and German translations, including
  the desktop entry and AppStream metadata
- Fixed: the global dictation shortcut could fail to register when another
  portal request won the startup race, leaving the hotkey dead until restart
- Fixed: Greek all-caps headings kept the tonos (a spelling error in Greek)
- Fixed: the Model page could show raw catalogue metadata in a status label
  on translated builds
- Changed: the update notice is a single clickable indicator in the status
  bar that opens the latest GitHub release
- Changed: assorted UI refinements

* Sat Aug 01 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.6.0-2
- Fixed: the Cohere Transcribe runtime failed to install — its bundled libtorch
  archive has ~9000 files, over the 8192 entry cap in the hardened zip
  extractor, so the download completed but extraction was refused and the model
  download stayed blocked ("Please download the runtime first"). Raised the
  entry-count ceiling; the byte-size and path-safety zip-bomb guards are
  unchanged.

* Sat Aug 01 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.6.0-1
- Fixed: auto-paste now works with the main window open in the background — the
  mini panel is no longer transient-for the main window, so keyboard focus (and
  the injected Ctrl+V) returns to the target app; delivery reports honestly and
  the Copied badge never lies
- Added: while-recording chunked decoding — long dictations are transcribed in
  pause-aligned chunks as you speak, so the wait after Stop stays short
- Added: warm sidecar servers for Qwen3-ASR and Cohere — model weights load
  once per session instead of on every dictation (automatic CLI fallback)
- Changed: one persistent RemoteDesktop portal session per app run (~1s less
  overhead per paste); paste permission is requested once, from Settings
- Changed: AI auto-improve no longer delays delivery (raw text first, polished
  variant follows); leaner decoding defaults (beam 2, no token timestamps)
- Changed: history/settings writes moved off the UI thread; instant recording
  start via device caching; live preview no longer self-disables on silence
- Fixed: finished transcriptions always reach History; dead microphones and
  desktop portal restarts recover automatically; transcription panics can no
  longer wedge the app
- Security: size-capped provider metadata, no-plaintext redirect policy,
  stronger secret redaction, minimal pre-auth health endpoint, strict language
  parameter validation, correct IPv6 Host parsing

* Wed Jul 22 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.5.0-5
- Fixed: dictation from the mini panel / global shortcut said "No model loaded"
  when the app was autostarted hidden — the selected model is now preloaded at
  startup, and the transcription worker lazy-loads it as a safety net
- Fixed: mini-panel dictation could translate speech to English even though the
  Translate toggles showed off — the saved toggle state was never restored into
  the UI, so a stale saved "on" kept translating silently
- Changed: refreshed the application logo (yellow microphone)
- Changed: the tray menu no longer shows an icon next to Quit

* Wed Jul 22 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.5.0-4
- Rebuilt against patched dependencies: rustls-webpki 0.103.13 fixes a reachable
  panic in CRL parsing plus three name-constraint advisories on the HTTPS path
  used for model downloads (RUSTSEC-2026-0104, -0099, -0098, -0049)

* Wed Jul 22 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.5.0-3
- Fixed the tray icon showing as an empty slot: the icon is now sent as raw
  pixels (StatusNotifier IconPixmap) instead of relying on a themed icon name

* Wed Jul 22 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.5.0-2
- Restored the symbolic tray icon to a readable size

* Wed Jul 22 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.5.0-1
- Verified and resumable model/runtime downloads
- Faster bounded inference and more reliable recording workflows
- Expanded History, safer AI integration, and refined application UI

* Thu Jun 11 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.4.0-2
- Added: Vulkan GPU acceleration for Whisper transcription. The binary now ships with whisper.cpp's Vulkan backend, so "Use GPU" in Settings runs the encoder on a Vulkan-capable GPU (with automatic CPU fallback if a GPU encode fails). Requires vulkan-loader.

* Mon Jun 08 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.4.0-1
- Fixed: the mini panel could fail mid-session with "Generic whisper error, code -6" on Vulkan GPUs, especially with larger models or wider beam search. The mini panel now uses a clean batch decode and the bug is gone.
- Fixed: borderline audio (whispered, noisy, or short clips) no longer breaks a whole transcription. Whisper's built-in temperature retry is re-enabled, so a difficult segment is degraded gracefully instead of throwing an error.
- Changed: "Show text live while transcribing" applies only to the main window now; the mini panel is always a clean batch decode. The Settings label says so explicitly.
- Changed: the beam_size setting is honoured everywhere — the main window's live preview no longer hard-codes greedy decoding. It still has a self-protection that pauses the loop if your hardware can't keep up.
- Changed: the mini panel's "Improve with AI" chips are consolidated into a single "Actions" dropdown next to Voice edit, matching the main window.
- Changed: Settings pages now fill the full content width instead of being clamped to a narrow centred column.

* Sat Jun 06 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.3.0-1
- Security & distribution hardening: verified downloads, keyring-only secrets, private/atomic config+history, LLM HTTPS enforcement + consent, resource limits, error/log redaction (see SECURITY.md / CHANGELOG.md)
- Auto-paste now off by default for new installs; update check is now a setting; clear-all history asks for confirmation
- Fixed: the mini panel pasted the previous transcript when you clicked into another window mid-recording — the clipboard is now set while the panel holds focus (Wayland requires this), so the current transcript is always pasted
- Fixed: the mini-panel AI icon now appears only when auto-improve will actually run

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-20
- Fixed: the mini panel sometimes auto-pasted the previous transcript instead of the current one. The clipboard is now flushed and confirmed live before the paste keystroke is sent (Wayland sets the selection asynchronously), so the current transcript is always pasted

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-19
- Fixed: regression in 1.2.0-18 where the main window's waveform/animation area expanded to fill the screen (huge empty gap). The visualizer is back to a fixed height, and the oversized mini-panel pin was removed

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-18
- Fixed: existing configs now get the improved "Clean up" prompt and an editable "Translate to {lang}" prompt (migrated automatically, unless you'd edited them)
- Changed: the Translate button now greys out (instead of disappearing) when a non-Whisper engine is selected
- Fixed: the dictation mini panel keeps a constant size across all states/openings
- Fixed: the main-window transcribing animation is the same height as the recording waveform (no layout shift)

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-17
- Fixed: Qwen3-ASR "Failed to load tokenizer / tokenizer.json not found" — the model dir now gets tokenizer.json (copied from the runtime bundle) at download time, and the transcribe path heals existing downloads automatically

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-16
- Fixed: the top-bar model dropdown now lists only DOWNLOADED Qwen3-ASR sizes (like Whisper); the active size auto-corrects to a downloaded one, and the list refreshes when you return to Transcription after downloading

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-15
- Changed: the active Qwen3-ASR model size (0.6B / 1.7B) is now chosen from the top-bar model dropdown, like Whisper — the "Active Model" row was removed from Settings → Model (downloads stay there)

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-14
- Added: choice of Qwen3-ASR model size — Small (0.6B, ~0.9 GB) or Full (1.7B, ~2.4 GB). Both can be downloaded and kept; pick the active one in Settings → Model

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-13
- Added: Qwen3-ASR as a third local transcription engine (Settings → Model → Engine). Runs offline via a downloadable runtime + ungated model (no account/token); 30 languages including Greek, with language auto-detect
- Changed: the "Improve with AI" toggle now switches silently (no toast), like Translate
- Fixed: the Translate LLM preset now shows an editable prompt (with a {lang} placeholder filled from the "Translate to" picker) instead of a blank, locked field
- Changed: the "Clean up" preset prompt now also reconstructs likely intent and fixes common speech-to-text mishearings
- Added: the main window now shows the same decode-sweep animation as the mini panel while transcribing

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-12
- Changed: "Improve with AI" is now a toggle that works like Translate — turn it on and your next transcriptions are automatically improved with the active LLM preset (no need to transcribe text first). It stays in sync with the "Auto-improve after dictation" setting

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-11
- Changed: the dictation mini panel now uses the main window's colours — the body matches the sidebar background and the top bar matches the header bar
- Changed: added a separator between the Translate and "Improve with AI" buttons in the controls row
- Changed: during recording, the LLM indicator icon now sits in the panel body (under the language label) instead of the top bar

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-10
- Changed: moved "Improve with AI" from the header to the controls row, next to Translate, with a label and an AI icon (manual send)
- Fixed: with "Auto-improve after dictation" off, the app no longer contacts the LLM at all (auto-titling is now gated behind the same toggle)
- Added: an AI indicator icon in the dictation mini panel when the LLM connection is enabled
- Changed: the mini panel result now shows the transcript inside a bordered card; fixed the Copy button (copies the shown text and flashes a "Copied" badge)
- Changed: increased the LLM request timeout to 300s so a server's first (cold) model load doesn't time out

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-9
- Added: LLM integration — a new "LLM" settings page to connect to any OpenAI-compatible server (LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, OpenAI). Configure the API URL, an optional API key (stored in the system keyring), temperature, and editable prompt presets (Clean up, Professional email, Summary, Translate, Code prompt)
- Added: "Improve with AI" — a header menu to run any preset on the current transcript (Replace + Undo), plus an optional "Auto-improve after dictation" that applies the active preset everywhere, including the mini panel / global dictation (shows an "Improving…" state before pasting)
- Added: model auto-discovery (GET /models) with a Refresh button and manual fallback; per-preset model/temperature overrides; a translate-language picker; a system-wide "Transform Selection with AI" (global shortcut + tray item) that rewrites the highlighted/copied text and pastes it back; and LLM auto-titling of new History entries
- Changed: refreshed the application icon (new logo) and the monochrome symbolic/tray icon to match

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-8
- Redesigned the dictation mini panel: slim header with a state dot + minimize/close, a colourful live waveform, an LED level meter, a tabular timer with centiseconds, an indeterminate decode sweep, and coloured New/Copy/Paste buttons; equal-size states, GNOME accent-aware colours

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-7
- Changed: default window width is now 1280px (sidebar stays fixed at 280px; only the right content area is wider)

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-6
- Changed: the Cohere Transcribe Runtime/Model rows now match the Whisper model rows — a dim size label, a trash button to delete the download, and the Download/Downloaded pill (replaces the "✅ Installed/Downloaded" status label)

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-5
- Fixed: the left sidebar is now locked to exactly 280px (a long GPU name no longer widens it); only the right content area grows on resize/maximize

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-4
- Added: the main window is now resizable and maximizable (drag the edges or use the maximize button); the left sidebar keeps a fixed width and only the right content area grows
- Added: "Keep Mini Panel on Top" option in Settings → Dictation (best-effort re-raise; on GNOME/Wayland use the panel titlebar menu → "Always on Top" for a guaranteed result)

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-3
- Fixed: selecting a model from the header dropdown now actually saves and loads it (the shared model-id list was being snapshot-copied, so user selections were silently ignored and reset to the saved model on restart)
- Improved: strip more Greek Whisper hallucinations appended on silence (e.g. "Σας ευχαριστούμε", "Υπότιτλοι …"), removing the longest match first so no orphan words are left behind

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-2
- Fixed: the selected Whisper model now persists across restarts (it was resetting to the first/Tiny model on every launch)
- Fixed: transcription now uses the model you selected instead of always falling back to Tiny

* Fri Jun 05 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.2.0-1
- Mini Panel with global dictation shortcut: transcribe, paste into the focused app, and keep dictating
- System tray icon and background mode
- Dictation modes: Plain, Message, Email, Note, Code Prompt
- Whisper Large v3 Turbo models
- Engine selector moved to Settings > Model ("Default Engine")
- Translate to English applies to the mini panel too
- Fixed auto-detect language producing empty transcriptions
- Fixed Cohere Transcribe language handling
- Fixed recording getting stuck repeating old text

* Sun Mar 29 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.1.0-1
- Multi-backend transcription engine support
- Fixed icon display in welcome wizard
- Stability and reliability improvements

* Sat Mar 07 2026 Christos A. Daggas <info@chrisdaggas.com> - 1.0.0-1
